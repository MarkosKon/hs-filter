#Limitations

- You can't add **multi-class** cards (like Kazakus) first in a deck. You need to add a class card first.
- You can't create a **Whizbang** deck. Whatever, it's just one card.ðŸ˜‚
- There is **no warning** if you include **Princes** and a card of the same cost.
- There is **no warning** if you include **Genn** with **odd** cards or **Baku** with **even** cards.
